# Longest and Second Longest Compound Word Finder

This Java program is designed to find the longest and second longest compound words in a text file. It also displays the time taken for execution.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Replace the placeholder "Input_01.txt" or "Input_02.txt" with the actual path to your text file in the LongestCompoundWordFinderr.java file.

3. Compile and run the Java program using your favorite Java development environment or command line.

4. The program will read the text file, analyze its content, and output the longest and second longest compound words along with the time taken for execution.

## How It Works

The program reads the content of the text file, tokenizes it into words, and processes these words to find compound words. It then determines the longest and second longest compound words in the file.

The time taken for execution is measured using the System.currentTimeMillis() method and displayed in milliseconds.
